    "## Abstract\n",
    "We will investigate evolutionary game theory strategies and their implementations to see which ones emerge dominant. We intend to use agent-based modeling (with the help of the Mesa python ABM library) to investigate it. Our first approach will be to mimic the “Evolution of Ethnocentrism” experiment and try various ways to extend it in small ways. A possible reach extension of this project could include implementing a genetic algorithm to see which aspects of strategies might appear in successful ones."

In particular, I want to come up interesting extensions that are not so complex that they muddle insights. I want to ask questions that can be compared to human behavior (like original question of ethnocentrism), and hopefully answer them with experiments in our model."
