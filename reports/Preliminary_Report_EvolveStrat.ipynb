    "# Evolving Game Strategies - Preliminary Report\n",
    "Authors: Subhash Gubba and Kai Levy\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "We will investigate evolutionary game theory strategies and their implementations to see which ones emerge dominant. We intend to use agent-based modeling (with the help of the Mesa python ABM library) to investigate it. Our first approach will be to mimic the “Evolution of Ethnocentrism” experiment and try various ways to extend it in small ways. A possible reach extension of this project could include implementing a genetic algorithm to see which aspects of strategies might appear in successful ones."

    "  *Investigates prisoner’s dilemma on a grid, with four basic tags and linked behaviors. Simulates the agents by playing the game one-off, with results having implications on individual reproductivity. Demonstrates that in-group favoritism can emerge as beneficial for groups, even when individual cooperation is costly.*\n",

Each round of the algorithm is a series of multiple games with randomly strategized players, and the emerging strategies show aspects of the two control strategies.*\n",
